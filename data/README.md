# Sample Data

To run the tests for the PDF parser, you need to provide sample PDF files in this directory.

*   `sample.pdf`: A simple PDF file with text content.
*   `sample_with_table.pdf`: A PDF file containing at least one table.
*   `sample_with_toc.pdf`: A PDF file with a table of contents.

You can use any PDF file for this purpose. A good source for sample PDFs is:
